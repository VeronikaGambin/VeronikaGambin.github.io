# Representative Projects

## Driving simulation-based maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT)

**Oct. 2024 - Ongoing**

<ProjectDetail image="/projects/DS.gif" hideBorder=true>
</ProjectDetail>

This project is supervised by [Dr Lakämper](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7393-7705) at [IRM UZH](https://www.irm.uzh.ch/de.html). 

 <!-- - **Description**: This project focuses on the investigation into facilitating the locomotion policies training process by integrating simulation, visualization, and analysis in a single tool. -->
 <!-- - **Main Work**: Conduct in-depth research on the Dynamics Explorer system and other relevant visualization techniques. Integrate state-of-the-art quadrupedal locomotion learning algorithms, leveraging platforms such as Isaac Gym and RaiSim for simulation and experimentation. -->

**Objective**: The current project focuses on validating a new standard driving-simulator-based maintenance of wakefulness test (DS-MWT) for precise assessment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). 

<!-- **Contributions**:
- Algorithm Research & Integration: Researched and implemented state-of-the-art locomotion learning algorithms. This step included reviewing the latest methodologies, identifying best practices, and customizing them for quadrupedal robots.
- Simulation Platform: Employed RaiSim, a physics engine, to simulate different locomotion learning scenarios and experiment with algorithm effectiveness, creating a controlled environment for testing.
- Visualization Website: Developed a web-based visualization platform to interpret the outcomes of different learning strategies, helping researchers analyze the learning behaviour and adjust strategies accordingly. -->
