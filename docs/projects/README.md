## Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithm for Drunk Driving Detection 

**Dec. 2023 - Ongoing**


This project is conducted at the [IoT Lab](https://www.iot-lab.ch/projects-connectedmobility/drive/) at ETHz, and under supervision of Professor [Manuel GÃ¼nther](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/aiml/people/guenther.html) at [AIML Group](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/aiml.html) of UZH.

- **Description**: Developed interpretable machine learning algorithms to detect drunk driving using a multi-sensor dataset, focusing on creating accurate models for effective interpretation. Explored various approaches for multivariate time-series classification and used them on driving data.
 - **Dataset**: Utilized a unique real-world dataset collected from real vehicles, including vehicle CAN bus data, eye tracking data, gas sensor data, vital sensor data, and in-vehicle radar data.
 - **Responsibilities**: Led the development and training of interpretable time-series classification models, employing techniques such as logistic regression, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, etc. Investigated methods for generating comprehensive explanations for model predictions.

This project is just for fun. It includes developing an AI player for the classic Windows game '3D Pinball Space Cadet', capable of learning from gameplay to achieve high scores. And it uses a combination of Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Genetic Algorithm.


## Explainability Method for Recommender Systems

**Feb. 2023 - Ongoing**

<ProjectDetail image="/projects/rose.png" hideBorder=true>
</ProjectDetail>

This project was under the supervision of Professor [Abraham Bernstein](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/ddis/people/bernstein.html) at [Dynamic and Distributed Information Systems Group](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/ddis.html) of UZH.

Through extensive research,  experiment, and testing, we implement eight recommenders, six explanation methods, and eight metrics. We summarize their requirements, limitations, and shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. We carry out detailed analysis for each applicable recommender-explanation-metric combination utilizing experiment pipeline and carefully crafted datasets. We complete this report by discussing key observations, comparing and contrasting model performance, and elaborating on our insights into the reasons behind the performance disparity. 


## GPT-Generated Text Detection

**Sep. 2023 - Oct. 2023**

[Code Here](https://github.com/yvonne-yiqin-zhang/GPT_Generated_Text_Detection)

Developed a system to differentiate between paragraphs written by humans and those generated by Chat-GPT. Utilized datasets comprising articles from Wikipedia and text generated by GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 using the same articles' starting sentences as prompts. Achieved high accuracy (>0.8) across all models.


## Influence Maximization in Twitter Network

**Sep. 2022 - Dec. 2022**

</ProjectDetail>

[Code Here](https://github.com/KniLIM)

KniLIM adopts a multi-platform approach, allowing usage on both browsers and desktops. Functionally, the system is divided into chat system, dynamic system, search system, friend system, group chat system, and recommendation system. The main features of the chat system include one-on-one chatting, text transmission, voice transmission, image and file transmission, and real-time audio-video calls. The dynamic system features friend updates. The search system enables searching chat records and friends. The friend system facilitates user registration, basic information input, friend addition, and deletion. The group chat system allows group creation and exit, group chatting, text transmission, voice transmission, and image and file transmission. The recommendation system provides friend and group suggestions.

In the core chat system, KniLIM employs a P2P architecture based on Socket long connections to ensure the timeliness of message exchange, while operations like login, registration, and friend addition utilize a short connection approach based on REST. Moreover, the server-side core functionalities are decoupled into different microservices, enabling mutual communication and invocation between services through RPC, thereby enhancing the system's flexibility and scalability.
