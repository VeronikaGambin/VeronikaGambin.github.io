Currently, I&#39;m doing my PhD in Neuroscience at the <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Zurich（UZH)</a>.</p><p>My research centers on understanding of sleep and sleep-related disorders. My work involves innovative experiments using driving simulations to investigate how various sleep-related disorders affect fitness to drive. By employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates advanced thechnologies and artificial intelligence, I aim to bridge the gap between scientific findings and practical applications, making impactful contributions to real-world challenges.</p><h2 id="education" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#education"><span>Education</span></a></h2>',4),g=s('<ul><li>Oct. 2024 - Present: PhD in Neuroscience, <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Zurich</a>, Switzerland</li><li>Feb. 2023 - Nov. 2024: Master of Science in Biology, <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Zurich</a>, Switzerland</li><li>Sep. 2017 - Jun. 2021: Bachelor of Science in Biology, <a href="https://english.spbu.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St Petersburg University</a>, Russia</li></ul><h2 id="projects" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#projects"><span>Projects</span></a></h2>',2),f=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"Driving simulation-based maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT)")],-1),_=e("p",null,"Current project focuses on validating a new standard driving-simulator-based maintenance of wakefulness test (DS-MWT) for precise assessment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).",-1),v=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"AI-based microsleep detection during driving")],-1),k=e("p",null,"Implementation of automated microsleep episode detection algorithm in DS-MWT for fitness-to-drive assessment.",-1),b=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"Auditory evoked potentials elicited by closed-loop stimulation during sleep in children and adults")],-1),w=e("p",null,"Investigation of the impact of closed-loop down-phase targeted stimulation during NREM sleep in a pediatric population and comparing the characteristics of AEP components (amplitude and latency) between children and adults to identify age-related differences.",-1),y=e("h2",{id:"on-campus-works",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#on-campus-works"},[e("span",null,"On-Campus Works")])],-1),S=e("li",null,[n("Fall 2023: Practical Tutor in the lecture "),e("a",{href:"https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/dast/teaching/FDS.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},'"Foundations of Data Science"'),n(" (MSc & PhD) at the University of Zurich")],-1);function P(l,B){const c=r("ProfileSection"),a=r("RouteLink"),o=r("ProjectCard");return u(),h("div",null,[t(c,{frontmatter:l.$page.frontmatter},null,8,["frontmatter"]),m,e("p",null,[t(a,{to:"/education/"},{default:i(()=>[n("→ To More Details")]),_:1})]),g,e("p",null,[t(a,{to:"/projects/"},{default:i(()=>[n("→ To Full List")]),_:1})]),t(o,{image:"/projects/1.png",hideBorder:"true"},{default:i(()=>[f,_]),_:1}),t(o,{image:"/projects/MSE.png",hideBorder:"true"},{default:i(()=>[v,k]),_:1}),t(o,{image:"/projects/AEP_ch_ad.png",hideBorder:"true"},{default:i(()=>[b,w]),_:1}),y,e("ul",null,[S,e("li",null,[n("Fall 2020: Teaching Assistant in the lecture "),t(a,{to:"/"},{default:i(()=>[n('"Compiler Theory"')]),_:1}),n(" (BEng) at Beihang University")]),e("li",null,[n("Spring 2020: Head Teaching Assistant in the lecture "),t(a,{to:"/"},{default:i(()=>[n('"Object-Oriented Programming (Java)"')]),_:1}),n(" (BEng) at Beihang University")]),e("li",null,[n("Fall 20129: Teaching Assistant in the lecture "),t(a,{to:"/"},{default:i(()=>[n('"Algorithm Analysis and Design"')]),_:1}),n(" (BEng) at Beihang University")])])])}const M=d(p,[["render",P],["__file","index.html.vue"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"path":"/","title":"Veronika Gambin","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"sidebar":"auto","sidebarDepth":2,"home":true,"title":"Veronika Gambin","externalLinkIcon":false,"pageClass":"home-page","lang":"en-US","name":"Veronika Gambin","profile":"/profile.png","socials":[{"title":"LinkedIn","icon":"/icons/logo-linkedin.svg","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronika-gambin"},{"title":"veronika.gambin@irm.uzh.ch","icon":"/icons/mail-outline.svg","link":"mailto:veronika.gambin@irm.uzh.ch"},{"title":"CV","icon":"/icons/document-outline.svg","link":"/cv/cv.pdf"},{"title":"Zurich, Switzerland","icon":"/icons/map-pin.svg","link":"https://maps.app.goo.gl/dApBUWdUZVYk4g7X7"}],"footer":"MIT Licensed | Powered by VuePress"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"About Me","slug":"about-me","link":"#about-me","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Education","slug":"education","link":"#education","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Projects","slug":"projects","link":"#projects","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"On-Campus Works","slug":"on-campus-works","link":"#on-campus-works","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1734017238000,"contributors":[{"name":"Veronika Gambin","email":"veronika.gambin@gmail.com","commits":13},{"name":"Li, Nan","email":"40530883+linan1109@users.noreply.github.com","commits":7},{"name":"linan1109","email":"linan119@yeah.net","commits":7}]},"filePathRelative":"README.md"}');export{M as comp,x as data};
