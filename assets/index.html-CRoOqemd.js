Currently, I&#39;m doing my PhD in Neuroscience at the <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Zurich（UZH)</a>.</p><p>My research centers on understanding of sleep and sleep-related disorders. My work involves innovative experiments using driving simulations to investigate how various sleep-related disorders affect fitness to drive. By employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates advanced thechnologies and artificial intelligence, I aim to bridge the gap between scientific findings and practical applications, making impactful contributions to real-world challenges.</p><h2 id="education" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#education"><span>Education</span></a></h2>',4),g=o('<ul><li>Oct. 2024 - Present: PhD in Neuroscience, <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Zurich</a>, Switzerland</li><li>Feb. 2023 - Nov. 2024: Master of Science in Biology, <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Zurich</a>, Switzerland</li><li>Sep. 2017 - Jun. 2021: Bachelor of Science in Biology, <a href="https://english.spbu.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St Petersburg University</a>, Russia</li></ul><h2 id="projects" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#projects"><span>Projects</span></a></h2>',2),f=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"Driving simulation-based maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT)")],-1),_=e("p",null,"Current project focuses on validating a new standard driving-simulator-based maintenance of wakefulness test (DS-MWT) for precise assessment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).",-1),v=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"AI-based microsleep detection during driving")],-1),b=e("p",null,"Implementation of automated microsleep episode detection algorithm in DS-MWT for fitness-to-drive assessment.",-1),k=e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"Auditory evoked potentials elicited by closed-loop stimulation during sleep in children and adults")],-1),w=e("p",null,"Investigation of the impact of closed-loop down-phase targeted stimulation during NREM sleep in a pediatric population and comparing the characteristics of AEP components (amplitude and latency) between children and adults to identify age-related differences.",-1),y=o('<h2 id="work-experience" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#work-experience"><span>Work Experience</span></a></h2><ul><li>Spring 2024: Freelance Neuroscience Consultant at <a href="https://wayvee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayvee</a>, developing of real-time customer satisfaction technology based on radio waves signal.</li><li>2022 - 2024: Research Assistant at <a href="https://www.uzh.ch/en/explore/hospitals/kispi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University Children&#39;s Hospital Zurich</a>, studying sleep and developmental processes.</li><li>2019 - 2022: Research Assistant at <a href="https://english.spbu.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St Petersburg State University</a>, studying psychophysiology of speech in children.</li></ul>',2);function S(l,x){const c=a("ProfileSection"),r=a("RouteLink"),i=a("ProjectCard");return p(),h("div",null,[n(c,{frontmatter:l.$page.frontmatter},null,8,["frontmatter"]),m,e("p",null,[n(r,{to:"/education/"},{default:t(()=>[s("→ To More Details")]),_:1})]),g,e("p",null,[n(r,{to:"/projects/"},{default:t(()=>[s("→ To Full List")]),_:1})]),n(i,{image:"/projects/DS.png",hideBorder:"true"},{default:t(()=>[f,_]),_:1}),n(i,{image:"/projects/MSE.PNG",hideBorder:"true"},{default:t(()=>[v,b]),_:1}),n(i,{image:"/projects/AEP_ch_ad.png",hideBorder:"true"},{default:t(()=>[k,w]),_:1}),y])}const j=d(u,[["render",S],["__file","index.html.vue"]]),M=JSON.parse('{"path":"/","title":"Veronika Gambin","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"sidebar":"auto","sidebarDepth":2,"home":true,"title":"Veronika Gambin","externalLinkIcon":false,"pageClass":"home-page","lang":"en-US","name":"Veronika Gambin","profile":"/profile.png","socials":[{"title":"LinkedIn","icon":"/icons/logo-linkedin.svg","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronika-gambin"},{"title":"veronika.gambin@irm.uzh.ch","icon":"/icons/mail-outline.svg","link":"mailto:veronika.gambin@irm.uzh.ch"},{"title":"CV","icon":"/icons/document-outline.svg","link":"/cv/cv.pdf"},{"title":"Zurich, Switzerland","icon":"/icons/map-pin.svg","link":"https://maps.app.goo.gl/dApBUWdUZVYk4g7X7"}],"footer":"MIT Licensed | Powered by VuePress"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"About Me","slug":"about-me","link":"#about-me","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Education","slug":"education","link":"#education","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Projects","slug":"projects","link":"#projects","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Work Experience","slug":"work-experience","link":"#work-experience","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1734088595000,"contributors":[{"name":"Veronika Gambin","email":"veronika.gambin@gmail.com","commits":14},{"name":"Li, Nan","email":"40530883+linan1109@users.noreply.github.com","commits":7},{"name":"linan1109","email":"linan119@yeah.net","commits":7}]},"filePathRelative":"README.md"}');export{j as comp,M as data};
